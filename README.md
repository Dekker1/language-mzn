## About MiniZinc

MiniZinc is a medium-level constraint modeling language. It is high-level enough to express most constraint problems easily, but low-level enough that it can be mapped onto existing solvers easily and consistently. It is a subset of the higher-level language Zinc.

MiniZinc is available from http://www.minizinc.org/
